# de2023-IntelligentFridge
This is the folder for the a intelligent fridge system. The fridge detects food in the fridge and automatically select those that is going to expire.
The fridge connects to a online recipe engine which will provide different types of recipes based on the food selected by the fridge.
The fridge can also sent instructions to other intelligent aplliances. They may be able to control the cooking time by themselves.
The script in MASTER is a script wriiten for the temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor component. The sensor I chose is BME280 Breakout - Temperature, Pressure, Humidity Sensor.
This should refer to the library Adafruit BME280 Library in Arduino IDE.
